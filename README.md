# Rogue 5.4

Rogue is a computer fantasy game with a new twist. It is crt oriented
and the object of the game is to survive the attacks of various monsters
and get a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation of
most computer fantasy games.

To get started you really only need to know two commands. The command
'?' will give you a list of the available commands and the command '/'
will identify the things you see on the screen.

To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's
high scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere
below the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out. Nobody has achieved
this yet and if somebody does, they will probably go down in history as
a hero among heroes.

When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you (by
some miracle) manage to win, rogue will give you a list of the top-ten
scorers. The scoring is based entirely upon how much gold you get.
There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.
