<pre><small><small><b><i>              Rogue</i></b>  is a visual CRT based fantasy game which runs



</small></small></pre>

<p><small><small>under the <small>UNIX</small> &dagger;
timesharing system. This paper de- scribes how to play
rogue, and gives a few hints for those who might otherwise
get lost in the Dungeons of Doom.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>1. Introduction</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>You have just finished your years as a
student at the local fighter&rsquo;s guild. After much
practice and sweat you have finally completed your training
and are ready to embark upon a perilous adventure. As a test
of your skills, the local guildmasters have sent you into
the Dungeons of Doom. Your task is to return with the Amulet
of Yendor. Your reward for the completion of this task will
be a full mem- bership in the local guild. In addition, you
are allowed to keep all the loot you bring back from the
dungeons.</small></small></p></td>

<p><small><small>In preparation for your journey, you are
given an enchanted mace, a bow, and a quiver of arrows taken
from a dragon&rsquo;s hoard in the far off Dark Mountains.
You are also outfitted with elf-crafted armor and given
enough food to reach the dungeons. You say goodbye to family
and friends for what may be the last time and head up the
road.</small></small></p></td>

<p><small><small>You set out on your way to the dungeons and
after sev- eral days of uneventful travel, you see the
ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of
Doom. It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance
and spend the night sleeping under the open skies. In the
morning you gather your weapons, put on your armor, eat what
is almost your last food, and enter the
dungeons.</small></small></p></td>

here?</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>You have just begun a game of rogue. Your
goal is to grab as much treasure as you can, find the Amulet
of Yendor, and get out of the Dungeons of Doom alive. On the
screen, a map of where you have been and what you have seen
on the current dungeon level is kept. As you explore more of
the level, it appears on the screen in front of
you.</small></small></p></td>

<p><small><small>Rogue differs from most computer fantasy
games in that it is screen oriented. Commands are all one or
two keystrokes <small><small>1</small></small> and the
results of your commands are displayed graphically on the
screen rather than being explained in words.

<td width="91%">
<p><small><small>Another major difference between rogue and
other com- puter fantasy games is that once you have solved
all the puzzles in a standard fantasy game, it has lost most
of its excitement and it ceases to be fun. Rogue, on the
other hand, generates a new dungeon every time you play it
and even the author finds it an entertaining and exciting
game.</small></small></p></td>

screen mean?</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>In order to understand what is going on in
rogue you have to first get some grasp of what rogue is
doing with the screen. The rogue screen is intended to
replace the &ldquo;You can see ...&rdquo; descriptions of
standard fantasy games. Figure</small></small></p>

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="91%">
<p><small><small>At the bottom line of the screen are a few
pieces of cryptic information describing your current
status. Here is an explanation of what these things
mean:</small></small></p></td>
</table>

<p><small><small>Level This number indicates how deep you
have gone in the dungeon. It starts at one and goes up as
you go deeper into the dungeon.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Gold The number of gold pieces you have
managed to find and keep with you so
far.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Hp Your current and maximum health points.
Health points indicate how much damage you can take before
you die. The more you get hit in a fight, the lower they
get. You can regain health points by resting. The number in
parentheses is the maximum number your health points can
reach.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Str Your current strength and maximum ever
strength. This can be any integer less than or equal to 31,
or greater than or equal to three. The higher the num- ber,
the stronger you are. The number in the paren- theses is the
maximum strength you have attained so far this
game.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Arm Your current armor protection. This
number indicates how effective your armor is in stopping
blows from unfriendly creatures. The higher this number is,
the more effective the armor.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Exp These two numbers give your current
experience level and experience points. As you do things,
you gain experience points. At certain experience point
totals, you gain an experience level. The more expe- rienced
you are, the better you are able to fight and to withstand
magical attacks.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>3.2. The top

<td width="91%">
<p><small><small>The top line of the screen is reserved for
printing messages that describe things that are impossible
to repre- sent visually. If you see a &ldquo;--More--&rdquo;
on the top line, this means that rogue wants to print
another message on the screen, but it wants to make certain
that you have read the one that is there first. To read the
next message, just type a space.</small></small></p></td>

<p><small><small><b>3.3. The rest of the
screen</b></small></small></p>

<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="91%">
<p><small><small>The rest of the screen is the map of the
level as you have explored it so far. Each symbol on the
screen repre- sents something. Here is a list of what the
various symbols mean:</small></small></p></td>
</table>

<p><small><small>@ This symbol represents you, the
adventurer.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>-| These symbols represent the walls of
rooms.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>+ A door to/from a
room.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>. The floor of a room.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small># The floor of a passage between
rooms.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>* A pile or pot of
gold.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>) A weapon of some
sort.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>] A piece of armor.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>! A flask containing a magic
potion.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>? A piece of paper, usually a magic
scroll.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>= A ring with magic
properties</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>/ A magical staff or
wand</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>^ A trap, watch out for
these.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>% A staircase to other
levels</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>: A piece of food.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>A-Z The uppercase letters represent the
various inhabitants of the Dungeons of Doom. Watch out, they
can be nasty and vicious.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>4. Commands</b></small></small></p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="91%">
<p><small><small>Commands are given to rogue by typing one
or two char- acters. Most commands can be preceded by a
count to repeat them (e.g. typing &ldquo;10s&rdquo; will do
ten searches). Commands for which counts make no sense have
the count ignored. To can- cel a count or a prefix, type
<small>&lt;ESCAPE&gt;</small> . The list of com- mands is
rather long, but it can be read at any time during the game
with the &ldquo;?&rdquo; command. Here it is for reference,
with a short explanation of each
command.</small></small></p></td>
</table>

<p><small><small>? The help command. Asks for a character
to give help on. If you type a &ldquo;*&rdquo;, it will list
all the commands, otherwise it will explain what the
character you typed does.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>/ This is the &ldquo;What is that on the
screen?&rdquo; command. A &ldquo;/&rdquo; followed by any
character that you see on the level, will tell you what that
character is. For instance, typing &ldquo;/@&rdquo; will
tell you that the &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol represents you, the
player.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>h, H, ^H</small></small></p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="91%">
<p><small><small>Move left. You move one space to the left.
If you use upper case &ldquo;h&rdquo;, you will continue to
move left until you run into something. This works for all
movement commands (e.g. &ldquo;L&rdquo; means run in
direction &ldquo;l&rdquo;) If you use the
&ldquo;control&rdquo; &ldquo;h&rdquo;, you will continue
moving in the specified direction until you pass something
interest- ing or run into a wall. You should experiment with
this, since it is a very useful command, but very dif-
ficult to describe. This also works for all movement
commands.</small></small></p></td>
</table>

<p><small><small>j Move down.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>k Move up.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>l Move right.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>y Move diagonally up and
left.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>u Move diagonally up and
right.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>b Move diagonally down and
left.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>n Move diagonally down and
right.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>t Throw an object. This is a prefix
command. When fol- lowed with a direction it throws an
object in the spec- ified direction. (e.g. type
&ldquo;th&rdquo; to throw something to the
left.)</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>f Fight until someone dies. When followed
with a direc- tion this will force you to fight the creature
in that direction until either you or it bites the big
one.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>m Move onto something without picking it
up. This will move you one space in the direction you
specify and, if there is an object there you can pick up, it
won&rsquo;t do it.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>z Zap prefix. Point a staff or wand in a
given direction and fire it. Even non-directional staves
must be pointed in some direction to be
used.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>^ Identify trap command. If a trap is on
your map and you can&rsquo;t remember what type it is, you
can get rogue to remind you by getting next to it and typing
&ldquo;^&rdquo; fol- lowed by the direction that would move
you on top of it.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>s Search for traps and secret doors.
Examine each space immediately adjacent to you for the
existence of a trap or secret door. There is a large chance
that even if there is something there, you won&rsquo;t find
it, so you might have to search a while before you find
something.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>&gt; Climb down a staircase to the next
level. Not surpris- ingly, this can only be done if you are
standing on staircase.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>&lt; Climb up a staircase to the level
above. This can&rsquo;t be done without the Amulet of Yendor
in your possession.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>. Rest. This is the &ldquo;do
nothing&rdquo; command. This is good for waiting and
healing.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>, Pick up something. This picks up
whatever you are cur- rently standing on, if you are
standing on anything at all.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>i Inventory. List what you are carrying in
your pack.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>I Selective inventory. Tells you what a
single item in your pack is.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>q Quaff one of the potions you are
carrying.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>r Read one of the scrolls in your
pack.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>e Eat food from your
pack.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>w Wield a weapon. Take a weapon out of
your pack and carry it for use in combat, replacing the one
you are currently using (if any).</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>W Wear armor. You can only wear one suit
of armor at a time. This takes extra
time.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>T Take armor off. You can&rsquo;t remove
armor that is cursed. This takes extra
time.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>P Put on a ring. You can wear only two
rings at a time (one on each hand). If you aren&rsquo;t
wearing any rings, this command will ask you which hand you
want to wear it on, otherwise, it will place it on the
unused hand. The program assumes that you wield your sword
in your right hand.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>R Remove a ring. If you are only wearing
one ring, this command takes it off. If you are wearing two,
it will ask you which one you wish to
remove,</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>d Drop an object. Take something out of
your pack and leave it lying on the floor. Only one object
can occupy each space. You cannot drop a cursed object at
all if you are wielding or wearing it.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>c Call an object something. If you have a
type of object in your pack which you wish to remember
something about, you can use the call command to give a name
to that type of object. This is usually used when you figure
out what a potion, scroll, ring, or staff is after you pick
it up, or when you want to remember which of those swords in
your pack you were wielding.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>D Print out which things you&rsquo;ve
discovered something about. This command will ask you what
type of thing you are interested in. If you type the
character for a given type of object (<i>e.g.</i>
&ldquo;!&rdquo; for potion) it will tell you which kinds of
that type of object you&rsquo;ve dis- covered (<i>i.e.</i>,
figured out what they are). This com- mand works for
potions, scrolls, rings, and staves and
wands.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>o Examine and set options. This command is
further explained in the section on
options.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>^R Redraws the screen. Useful if spurious
messages or transmission errors have messed up the
display.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>^P Print last message. Useful when a
message disappears before you can read it. This only repeats
the last message that was not a mistyped command so that you
don&rsquo;t loose anything by accidentally typing the wrong
character instead of ^P.</small></small></p>
